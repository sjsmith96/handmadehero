There are two memory areas.
One memory area is for permanent storage that needs to be preserved from frame to frame.
The other area is for transient storage that doens't need to be preserved from frame to frame.

LRU - "Least recently used"

We're going to be looping through the array of ground buffers seeing which ones we need to render
If we encoutner one that doesn't need to be rendered we could do array compaction --
moving subsequent elements down and shuffling it down past the elements that actually need to get rendered

If you needed to allocate memory and you didn't know how much the program would need you could just ask
the system for another block of memory every time you ran out, linking them together and freeing them
all when you're done.
