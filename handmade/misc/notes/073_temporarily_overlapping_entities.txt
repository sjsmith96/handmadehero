You can remove an element from the middle of an array by:
Assign the element you want to remove to the (--Array count)
This will mess up the order though

For rectangles to intersect they must have at least one point in common
If the rectangles are axis aligned (not rotated) and have one point in common in all 3 dimensions
then they must intersect

If (min of A.X > max of B.X ||
    min of B.X > max of A.X)
    
        then they don't intersect.

Else they do intersect.
