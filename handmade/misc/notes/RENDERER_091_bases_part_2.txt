Rotation and scaling can be achieved by rotating and scaling the basis vectors you're using to construct the shape/bitmap w/e it is you're drawing

The new point is the origin plus the x coordinate of the original point along the x axis plus the y coordinate of the orignal point along the y axis

xaxis = (cos(theta), sin(theta))
yaxis = (-sin(theta), cos(theta))

To scale you multiply those x and y axis vectors by the scale

Perp operator takes a 2d vector and produces a vector that is perpendicular to it
f(x, y) -> (-y, x)

rotation by theta -> x axis = cos(theta), sin(theta)
                     y axis = perp(x axis)

P = Entry->Origin + P.x*Entry->XAxis + P.y*Entry->YAxis;
