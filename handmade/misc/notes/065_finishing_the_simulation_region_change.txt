We have the permanent block of memory and the transient block of memory.

Permanent is stuff like entities, game state.

The transient block is scratch pad where stuff that is only used for calculations go.
We're going to divide it up into chunks. When something needs memory to do calculations it's going to grab
a chunk of it. Use it to do its calculations and then get rid of it all when it's done.
