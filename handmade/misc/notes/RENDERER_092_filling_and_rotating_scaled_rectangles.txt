What pixels are filled?

If we were to rotate and scale an entire rectangle, what would we actually fill on the screen?
What are all of the pixels that would actually be included in the rectangle?

For testing to see if a certain point is inside a rectangle we did
x >= min.x &&
x < max.x &&
y >= min.y &&
y < max.y

This is an "edge test"

For a rotated and scaled rectangle we could devise a similar edgetest

Inner(p - origin, perp)
If the sign of the dot product is positive it is outside the edge
If it's negative its inside the edge.
