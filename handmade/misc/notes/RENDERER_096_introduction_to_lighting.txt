Lighting is the sound of graphics

Lighting is fundamentally a "directional" effect

For games we want:
- Diffuse surfaces
    - chalk
    - light scatters in all directions evenly (diffusely)
    
- "glossy" surfaces
    - some of the light reflects out the opposite direction but some of it scatters

- highly reflective surfaces
    - mirrors
    - light reflects right back out the opposite direction

Approximations

"Light probing (indirect light sampling)"
    - Can we compute lookup tables or something like that that would let us look at all the different light
    sources that are coming into a surface?
    
What do we do in 2d?
Problems:
 - We don't know what the surfaces are
    - normal maps:
        - you have a bitmap of your texture
        - you store a second map but instead of RBG you store XYZ of a vector that points in the
        direction the surface is pointing at that time
- We don't know what the light field is
    - point lights
    - light rendering
        -
