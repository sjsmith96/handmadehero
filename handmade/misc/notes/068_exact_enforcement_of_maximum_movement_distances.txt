"Double Dispatch"

What happens when a sword hits another sword?
What happens when a sword hits a monster?

When a hero collides w/ a monster you probably don't do anything differently
than when a monster collides with a hero

In MoveEntity we don't care which Entity was passed in and which one was hit

How many dispatch routines do we have?

types^2/2

With these numbers you would need 200 dispatch routines for 20 types of entities. Way too many.

One solution to the double dispatch problem is to have only a few entity types or only a few response routines.
For example you could just do nothing when most entity types collide. <- "AAAness"

Another solution is to get the matrix of entity interactions filled without writing new routines each time.
"Fundamental qualities"
8 fundamental qualities ~40 routines
"properties"
Entities are defined by their fundamental properties rather than their type.
