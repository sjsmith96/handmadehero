Suppose that we were to draw a spirte house (fig 1.)
That's our house bitmap.
How would we find Normal N?

If we have points P0 and P1 we can find the vector between them (v)

The normal is the vector that is perpindicular to vector v

If we rotated the bitmap as in fig 2. The points P0 and P1 would rotate by the standard rotation

POx*xAxis + P0y*Yaxis = P0'
P1x*xAxis + P1y*Yaxis = P1'

Similarly for rotating the normal

Nx*Xaxis + Ny*Yaxis = N'

If we were to scale the bitmap by 2x that would also work out fine with scaling the normal because
the direction is uniform. We just have to make sure we change the normal back to length 1 after.

Suppose we scaled the axes non uniformly. In fig. 3 we scale the x axis 2x.

If we naively scaled the normal as we did before the normal would be pointing lower than it was before.
But just looking at the image we can see that that's incorrect. The normal ought to be pointing higher
than it was before.

Because the construction of a perpindicular looks like this:

Perp(v) = {-v.y, v.x};

If we scale only the x up, the y component of the perp will be affected. (Because the x component of the original vector is the y component of the normal.)

The actual transformation we want to preform to our normal is:

Nx * (Xaxis / Length(Xaxis)) * Length(Yaxis) + Ny * (Yaxis / Length(Yaxis)) * Length(Xaxis)  

or

Nx * (Length(Yaxis) / Length(Xaxis) * X + Ny (Length(Xaxis) / Length (Yaxis)) * Y

So these: (|y|/|x|) and (|x|/|y|) are coefficients we need to multiply into the standard transform we talked about above

Notice how if the axes are scaled uniformly, these coefficients are simply 1 and therefore the transform is the same as the standard transform.

See fig 4 for an explanation for why we need a NzScale factor.
When we scale the normal with the tranform above we're only affecting its x and y components

When we normalize that normal vector again (without changing the z) it's going to wrong because it's going
to be completely dominated by its X and Y.

To compensate we are multiplying the z component of the unscaled normal by the average length of the x and y axes
before normalizing.
