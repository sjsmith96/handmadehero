Normal Maps:

1 - Description of the surface
2 - Description of the light
3 - Equation in terms
    - Normal
    - View direction
    - Light direction

The equation needs to take a description of the surface and output a light value.

We have the texture for the tree
We need a map of vectors instead of RGB values that's going to encode the normal.
Every texel on the normal map will have x,y,z values from 0-255
