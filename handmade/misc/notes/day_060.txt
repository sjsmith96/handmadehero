We want to allign the hipoint hearts below the player.

The y component of that is easy. They're just some fixed distance below the player.
The x component of that is a bit more tricky.
In the even case there would be a center line with an equal amount of hearts on either side of it.

      |
     / \

[] [] | [] []
      |
      |  <- Center line

In the odd case the center line would need to bisect the middle heart


       0
       |
      / \

[] [] [|] [] []
       |
       |  <- Center line



     
Let 's' be the space between the hearts (from their center points across the x axis)
Let 'n' be the count (the maximum number of hearts)

We should draw the first heart at (n - 1) * (0.5 * s)
Then just move by 's' and draw the next heart until we've drawn them all.
