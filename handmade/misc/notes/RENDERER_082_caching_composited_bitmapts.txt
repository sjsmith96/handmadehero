RENDERER LFG

LERP: (1.0f - t)*A + t*B

t is a normal value
A - t*A + t*B
A+t(B - A)

in other words Min + t * Range

We're now baking whether the bitmap is drawn bottom up or top down into the Pitch.
So right now when bitmaps are loaded the pitch is equal to the bytes per pxiel * the width of the bitmap,
negated.

You want to be able to draw into bitmaps you draw from because that's what allows you to cache.
We now draw into a "GroundBuffer" on startup that is cached in the GameState and redrawn as essentially
the background every frame as one cached bitmap instead of stamping each individual grass/rock bitmap
every single frame over and over again.

For rendering you want all the routines for drawing to be able to draw _to_ the things you draw _from_.
