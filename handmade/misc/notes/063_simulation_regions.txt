Two constraints:

Extremely large world
Extremely large entity counts

The problem with the large world constraint is float precision
The problem with large entity counts is processing power


Low entities will be storage only
A "simulation region" like the camera, but invisible to
the player will go around, pull low entities into high,
simulate them, then make them back into low.
